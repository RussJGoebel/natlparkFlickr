Description: This package contains two datasets: flickr_userdays stores a time series of national level user-days for Flickr between 2005 and 2018, and park_visitation stores Flickr photo-user-days associated with twenty popular national parks in the United States. Here, user-days counts the number of unique Flickr users in a day, and photo-user-days counts the number of unique users who post a photo on Flickr from within the boundary of a given park.
