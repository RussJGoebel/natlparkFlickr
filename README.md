The goal of natlparkAnalysis is to use the VisitorCounts package to
reprocute the figures in “Modeling and Forecasting Percent Changes in
National ParkVisitation Using Social Media”.

## Installation

The development version can be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RussJGoebel/natlparkAnalysis")
```

Code which reproduces the figures can be found in vignettes.
